# Mountains

This project was done in scope of the course "Introduction to Computer Graphics" at the Swiss Polytechnic Institute of Technology, in spring 2015. The goal was to learn OpenGL (with C++), how the graphic pipeline works, and how to program shaders in GLSL.

The project is on stand by but I'd love to improve it and port it to WebGL when I have the time.

## Compiling the project with Visual Studio

In CMake, set the location of the source code as `path/to/procedural-terrain`. Choose where to build the binaries, for example `path/to/procedural-terrain/bin`.
Click configure and specify `Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64` or later as the generator for this project. Then generate and you are ready to open `path/to/procedural-terrain/bin/Moutains.sln`.
Finally, set the working direcory (`right click on Moutains > properties > debugging`) as `../../src`.

## Some tips to use the project

+ W-A-S-D-SHIFT-SPACE are the keys to move around the terrain.
+ 5 different modes :
    - 1) FREE MODE : you can go around the terrain freely and go up and down using SHIFT and SPACE.
    - 2) FPS MODE : you can only use WASD keys and go around the terrain, the height will be the height of your noise.
    - 3) BEZIER MODE : display your Bezier curve on your terrain.
    - 4) BEZIER EDIT MODE : you can change the positions of the point that determines Bezier curves.
    - 5) INERTIA MODE : Same as FREE MODE but with inertia.
+ You can use tweakbar to change the terrain, make sure you are in NO_THEME (at the top of the tweakbar) if you want to change every parameters.
